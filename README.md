## About me :mortar_board:
I am 19 years old and I am a student.I started programming at 16 years old.
I was curious about the programming and my first learning was with the free courses of the city government. This helped me develop a good technological mindset and want to get more into the IT world developing web pages and mobile applications. I like to face challenges every day and learn from people, acquiring knowledge and experience. I think that >>> **no knowledge is enough**.
